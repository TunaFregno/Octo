# Octo
```
We are a group of students that developed OCTO<, a Tournament Web-based application as our final project of the Full-Stack Bootcamp at Propulsion Academy AG, in a period of 2 and a half weeks.
OCTO stands for Organize Create Tournaments Online. Currently, our app can track three different sports (Football, Tennis, and Ping-Pong) and two types of format (Round-Robin and Single Elimination).
Our goal is to expand OCTO into tracking all sorts of sports with additional formats.
